What concerns would you have from a testing perspective?
  Whether the interface is beautiful and flawless. Whether the interface elements, input boxes, text, etc. are aligned and the sizes are uniform. Whether the font, color, and size   of the interface are correct. Whether the content of the element is friendly and easy to understand. compatibility broswer test, and some positive and negitivate test.
How would you go about tackling the QA for this work?
I use jira or Azure devops tracking to follow issues.
  do manual and automation test
What sort of tests would be worth describing or worth automating?
  if the UI is not stable too much then we will not automate the module and rather we will automate the api part of it and add scenarios for UI automation and add test later. 
What tools would you use?
  Selenium webdriver and webdriverIO and cucumber and  mocha and chai
